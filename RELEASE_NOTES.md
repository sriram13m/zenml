# 0.7.2

0.7.2 is a minor release which quickly patches some bugs found in the last
release to do with Seldon and Mlflow deployment.

This release also features initial versions of two amazing new integrations:
[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) and [Weights&Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)!

- HuggingFace models are now supported to be passed through ZenML pipelines!
- You can now track your pipeline runs with Weights&Biases with the new
`enable_wandb` decorator!

Continuous model deployment with MLflow has been improved with ZenML 0.7.2. A new
MLflow Model Deployer Stack component is now available and needs to be part of
your stack to be able to deploy models:

```bash
zenml integration install mlflow
zenml model-deployer register mlflow --type=mlflow
zenml stack register local_with_mlflow -m default -a default -o default -d mlflow
zenml stack set local_with_mlflow
```

The MLflow Model Deployer is yet another addition to the list of Model Deployers
available in ZenML. You can read more on deploying models to production with MLflow
in our [Continuous Training and Deployment documentation section](https://docs.zenml.io/features/continuous-training-and-deployment) and our [MLflow deployment example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/mlflow_deployment).

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/compare/0.7.1...0.7.2

# 0.7.1

The release introduces the [Seldon Core](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core) ZenML integration, featuring the
*Seldon Core Model Deployer* and a *Seldon Core standard model deployer step*.
The [*Model Deployer*](https://docs.zenml.io/core-concepts#model-deployer)
is a new type of stack component that enables you to develop continuous
model deployment pipelines that train models and continuously deploy them to an
external model serving tool, service or platform. You can read more on deploying models
to production with Seldon Core in our
[Continuous Training and Deployment documentation section](https://docs.zenml.io/features/continuous-training-and-deployment) and our [Seldon Core deployment example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/seldon_deployment).

We also see two new integrations with [Feast](https://feast.dev) as ZenML's first feature store integration. Feature stores allow data teams to serve data via an offline store and an online low-latency store where data is kept in sync between the two. It also offers a centralized registry where features (and feature schemas) are stored for use within a team or wider organization. ZenML now supports connecting to a Redis-backed Feast feature store as a stack component integration. Check out the [full example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/release/0.7.1/examples/feature_store) to see it in action! 

0.7.1 also brings  an addition to ZenML training library integrations with [NeuralProphet](https://neuralprophet.com/html/index.html). Check out the new [example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples) for more details, and the [docs](https://docs.zenml.io) for more further detail on all new features!

# 0.7.0

With ZenML 0.7.0, a lot has been revamped under the hood about how things are stored. Importantly what this means is that ZenML now has [system-wide profiles](https://docs.zenml.io/features/profiles) that let you register stacks to share across several of your projects! If you still want to manage your stacks for each project folder individually, profiles still let you do that as well.

Most projects of any complexity will require passwords or tokens to access data and infrastructure, and for this purpose ZenML 0.7.0 introduces [the Secrets Manager](https://docs.zenml.io/features/secrets) stack component to seamlessly pass around these values to your steps. Our AWS integration also allows you to use AWS Secrets Manager as a backend to handle all your secret persistence needs.

Finally, in addition to the new AzureML and Sagemaker Step Operators that version 0.6.3 brought, this release also adds the ability to [run individual steps on GCP's Vertex AI](https://docs.zenml.io/v/docs/features/step-operators).

Beyond this, some smaller bugfixes and documentation changes combine to make ZenML 0.7.0 a more pleasant user experience.

# 0.6.3

With ZenML 0.6.3, you can now run your ZenML steps on Sagemaker and AzureML! It's normal to have certain steps that require specific hardware on which to run model training, for example, and this latest release gives you the power to switch out hardware for individual steps to support this.

We added a new Tensorboard visualisation that you can make use of when using our Kubeflow Pipelines integration. We handle the background processes needed to spin up this interactive web interface that you can use to visualise your model's performance over time.

Behind the scenes we gave our integration testing suite a massive upgrade, fixed a number of smaller bugs and made documentation updates. For a detailed look at what's changed, give [our full release notes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/releases/tag/0.6.3) a glance.

# 0.6.2

ZenML 0.6.2 brings you the ability to serve models using MLflow deployments as well as an updated CLI interface! For a real continuous deployment cycle, we know that ZenML pipelines should be able to handle everything — from pre-processing to training to serving to monitoring and then potentially re-training and re-serving. The interfaces we created in this release are the foundation on which all of this will build.

We also improved how you interact with ZenML through the CLI. Everything looks so much smarter and readable now with the popular `rich` library integrated into our dependencies.

Smaller changes that you'll notice include updates to our cloud integrations and bug fixes for Windows users. For a detailed look at what's changed, see below.

# 0.6.0

ZenML 0.6.0 is out now. We've made some big changes under the hood, but our biggest public-facing addition is our new integration to support all your data logging needs: [`whylogs`](https://github.com/whylabs/whylogs). Our core architecture was [thoroughly reworked](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/305) and is now in a much better place to support our ongoing development needs.


Smaller changes that you'll notice include extensive documentation additions, updates and fixes. For a detailed look at what's changed, see below.

## 📊 Whylogs logging

[Whylogs](https://github.com/whylabs/whylogs) is an open source library that analyzes your data and creates statistical summaries called whylogs profiles. Whylogs profiles can be visualized locally or uploaded to the WhyLabs platform where more comprehensive analysis can be carried out.

ZenML integrates seamlessly with Whylogs and [WhyLabs](https://whylabs.ai/). This example shows how easy it is to enhance steps in an existing ML pipeline with Whylogs profiling features. Changes to the user code are minimal while ZenML takes care of all aspects related to Whylogs session initialization, profile serialization, versioning and persistence and even uploading generated profiles to [Whylabs](https://whylabs.ai/).

![Example of the visualizations you can make from Whylogs profiles](https://blog.zenml.io/assets/posts/release_0_6_0/whylogs-visualizer.png)

With our `WhylogsVisualizer`, as described in [the associated example notes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/0.6.0/examples/whylogs), you can visualize Whylogs profiles generated as part of a pipeline.

## ⛩ New Core Architecture

We implemented [some fundamental changes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/305) to the core architecture to solve some of the issues we previously had and provide a more extensible design to support quicker implementations of different stack components and integrations. The main change was to refactor the `Repository`, `Stack` and `StackComponent` architectures. These changes had a pretty wide impact so involved changes in many files throughout the codebase, especially in the CLI which makes calls to all these pieces.

We've already seen how it helps us move faster in building integrations and we hope it helps making contributions as pain-free as possible!

## 🗒 Documentation and Example Updates

As the codebase and functionality of ZenML grows, we always want to make sure our documentation is clear, up-to-date and easy to use. We made a number of changes in this release that will improve your experience in this regard:

- added a number of new explainers on key ZenML concepts and how to use them in your code, notably on [how to create a custom materializer](https://docs.zenml.io/v/0.6.0/guides/index/custom-materializer) and [how to fetch historic pipeline runs](https://docs.zenml.io/v/0.6.0/guides/index/historic-runs) using the `StepContext`
- fixed a number of typos and broken links
- [added versioning](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/336) to our API documentation so you can choose to view the reference appropriate to the version that you're using. We now use `mkdocs` for this so you'll notice a slight visual refresh as well.
- added new examples highlighting specific use cases and integrations:
	- how to create a custom materializer ([example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/0.6.0/examples/custom_materializer))
	- how to fetch historical pipeline runs ([example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/0.6.0/examples/fetch_historical_runs))
	- how to use standard interfaces for common ML patterns ([example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/0.6.0/examples/standard_interfaces))
	- `whylogs` logging ([example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/0.6.0/examples/whylogs))

## ➕ Other updates, additions and fixes

As with most releases, we made a number of small but significant fixes and additions. The most import of these were that you can now [access the metadata store](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/338) via the step context. This enables a number of new possible workflows and pipeline patterns and we're really excited to have this in the release.

We [added in](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/315) a markdown parser for the `zenml example info …` command, so now when you want to use our CLI to learn more about specific examples you will see beautifully parsed text and not markdown markup.

We improved a few of our error messages, too, like for when the return type of a step function [doesn’t match the expected type](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/322), or if [step is called twice](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/353). We hope this makes ZenML just that little bit easier to use.

# 0.5.7

ZenML 0.5.7 is here  :100:  and it brings not one, but :fire:TWO:fire: brand new integrations :rocket:! ZenML now support [MLFlow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html) for tracking pipelines as experiments and [Evidently](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently) for detecting drift in your ML pipelines in production!

    /___|  \___|  |_||_|  |_|  |_| |____| 

This release fixes some known bugs from previous releases and especially 0.5.5. Therefore, upgrading to 0.5.6 is a **breaking change**. You must do the following in order to proceed with this version:

```
cd zenml_enabled_repo
rm -rf .zen/
```

And then start again with ZenML init:

```
pip install --upgrade zenml
zenml init
```

## New Features
* Added `zenml example run [EXAMPLE_RUN_NAME]` feature: The ability to run an example with one command. In order to run this, do `zenml example pull` first and see all examples available by running `zenml example list`.
* Added ability to specify a `.dockerignore` file before running pipelines on Kubeflow.
* Kubeflow Orchestrator is now leaner and faster. 
* Added the `describe` command group to the CLI for groups `stack`, `orchestrator`, `artifact-store`, and `metadata-store`. E.g. `zenml stack describe`

## Bug fixes and minor improvements
* Adding `StepContext` to a branch now invalidates caching by default. Disable explicitly with `enable_cache=True`.
* Docs updated to reflect minor changes in CLI commands.
* CLI `list` commands now mentions active component. Try `zenml stack list` to check this out.
* `zenml version` now has cooler art.

## Overview

* Pipeline can now be run via a YAML file. #132
* CLI now let's you pull directly from GitHub examples folder. :fire: Amazing @alex-zenml with #141!
* ZenML now has full [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) compliance. :tada: Thanks @schustmi for #140!
* Numerous bugs and performance improvements. #136, @bcdurak great job with #142
* Added new docs with a low level API guide. #143

[Our roadmap](https://docs.zenml.io/support/roadmap) goes into further detail on the timeline. Vote on the [next features now](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/discussions).

We encourage every user (old or new) to start afresh with this release. Please go over our latest [docs](https://docs.zenml.io) and [examples](examples) to get a hang of the new system.


# 0.5.0
This long-awaited ZenML release marks a seminal moment in the project's history. We present to you a complete 
revamp of the internals of ZenML, with a fresh new design and API. While these changes are significant, and have been months 
in the making, the original vision of ZenML has not wavered. We hope that the ZenML community finds the new 
design choices easier to grasp and use, and we welcome feedback on the [issues board](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/issues).

## Warning
0.5.0 is a complete API change from the previous versions of ZenML, and is a *breaking* upgrade. Fundamental 
concepts have been changed, and therefore backwards compatibility is not maintained. Please use only this version 
with fresh projects.

With such significant changes, we expect this release to also be breaking. Please report any bugs in the issue board, and 
they should be addressed in upcoming releases.

## Overview

* Introducing a new functional API for creating pipelines and steps. This is now the default mechanism for building ZenML pipelines. [read more](https://docs.zenml.io/quickstart-guide)
* Steps now use Materializers to handle artifact serialization/deserialization between steps. This is a powerful change, and will be expanded upon in the future. [read more](https://docs.zenml.io/core/materializers)
* Introducing the new `Stack` paradigm: Easily transition from one MLOps stack to the next with a few CLI commands [read more](https://docs.zenml.io/core/stacks)
* Introducing a new `Artifact`, `Typing`, and `Annotation` system, with `pydantic` (and `dataclasses`) support [read more](https://docs.zenml.io/core/artifacts)
* Deprecating the `pipelines_dir`: Now individual pipelines will be stored in their metadata stores, making the metadata store a single source of truth. [read more](https://docs.zenml.io/core/stacks)
* Deprecating the YAML config file: ZenML no longer natively compiles to an intermediate YAML-based representation. Instead, it compiles and deploys directly into the selected orchestrator's 
representation. While we do plan to support running pipelines directly through YAML in the future, it will no longer be
the default route through which pipelines are run. [read more about orchestrators here](https://docs.zenml.io/core/stacks)

## Technical Improvements
* A completely new system design, please refer to the [docs](https://docs.zenml.io/core/core-concepts).
* Better type hints and docstrings.
* Auto-completion support.
* Numerous performance improvements and bug fixes, including a smaller dependency footprint.

## What to expect in the next weeks and the new ZenML
Currently, this release is bare bones. We are missing some basic features which used to be part of ZenML 0.3.8 (the previous release):

* Standard interfaces for `TrainingPipeline`.
* Individual step interfaces like `PreprocessorStep`, `TrainerStep`, `DeployerStep` etc. need to be rewritten from within the new paradigm. They should
be included in the non-RC version of this release.
* A proper production setup with an orchestrator like Airflow.
* A post-execution workflow to analyze and inspect pipeline runs.
* The concept of `Backends` will evolve into a simple mechanism of transitioning individual steps into different runners.
* Support for `KubernetesOrchestrator`, `KubeflowOrchestrator`, `GCPOrchestrator` and `AWSOrchestrator` are also planned.
* Dependency management including Docker support is planned.

[Our roadmap](https://docs.zenml.io/support/roadmap) goes into further detail on the timeline.

We encourage every user (old or new) to start afresh with this release. Please go over our latest [docs](https://docs.zenml.io) 
and [examples](examples) to get a hang of the new system.

Onwards and upwards to 1.0.0!

* A proper production setup with an orchestrator like Airflow.
* A post-execution workflow to analyze and inspect pipeline runs.
* The concept of `Backends` will evolve into a simple mechanism of transitioning individual steps into different runners.
* Support for `KubernetesOrchestrator`, `KubeflowOrchestrator`, `GCPOrchestrator` and `AWSOrchestrator` are also planned.
* Dependency management including Docker support is planned.

[Our roadmap](https://docs.zenml.io/support/roadmap) goes into further detail on the timeline.

We encourage every user (old or new) to start afresh with this release. Please go over our latest [docs](https://docs.zenml.io) 
and [examples](examples) to get a hang of the new system.

Onwards and upwards to 1.0.0!

# 0.3.7.1
This release fixes some known bugs from previous releases and especially 0.3.7. Same procedure as always, please delete existing pipelines, metadata, and artifact stores.

```
cd zenml_enabled_repo
rm -rf pipelines/
rm -rf .zenml/
```

And then another ZenML init:

```
pip install --upgrade zenml
cd zenml_enabled_repo
zenml init
```

## New Features
* Introduced new `zenml example` CLI sub-group: Easily pull examples via zenml to check it out.

```bash
zenml example pull # pulls all examples in `zenml_examples` directory
zenml example pull EXAMPLE_NAME  # pulls specific example
zenml example info EXAMPLE_NAME  # gives quick info regarding example
```  
Thanks Michael Xu for the suggestion!

* Updated examples with new `zenml examples` paradigm for examples.

## Bug Fixes + Refactor

* ZenML now works on Windows -> Thank you @Franky007Bond for the heads up.
* Updated numerous bugs in examples directory. Also updated README's.
* Fixed remote orchestration logic -> Now remote orchestration works.
* Changed datasource `to_config` to include reference to backend, metadata, and artifact store.


# 0.3.7
0.3.7 is a much-needed, long-awaited, big refactor of the Datasources paradigm of ZenML. There are also bug fixes, improvements, and more!

For those upgrading from an older version of ZenML, we ask to please delete their old `pipelines` dir and `.zenml` folders and start afresh with a `zenml init`.

If only working locally, this is as simple as:

```
cd zenml_enabled_repo
rm -rf pipelines/
rm -rf .zenml/
```

And then another ZenML init:

```
pip install --upgrade zenml
cd zenml_enabled_repo
zenml init
```

## New Features
* The inner-workings of the `BaseDatasource` have been modified along with the concrete implementations. Now, there is no relation between a `DataStep` and a `Datasource`: A `Datasource` holds all the logic to version and track itself via the new `commit` paradigm.

* Introduced a new interface for datasources, the `process` method which is responsible for ingesting data and writing to TFRecords to be consumed by later steps.

* Datasource versions (snapshots) can be accessed directly via the `commits` paradigm: Every commit is a new version of data.

* Added `JSONDatasource` and `TFRecordsDatasource`.

## Bug Fixes + Refactor
A big thanks to our new contributor @aak7912 for the help in this release with issue #71 and PR #75.

* Added an example for [regression](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/regression).
* `compare_training_runs()` now takes an optional `datasource` parameter to filter by datasource.
* `Trainer` interface refined to focus on `run_fn` rather than other helper functions.
* New docs released with a streamlined vision and coherent storyline: https://docs.zenml.io
* Got rid of unnecessary Torch dependency with base ZenML version.


# 0.3.6
0.3.6 is a more inwards-facing release as part of a bigger effort to create a more flexible ZenML. As a first step, ZenML now supports arbitrary splits for all components natively, freeing us from the `train/eval` split paradigm. Here is an overview of changes:

## New Features
* The inner-workings of the `BaseTrainerStep`, `BaseEvaluatorStep` and the `BasePreprocessorStep` have been modified along with their respective components to work with the new split_mapping. Now, users can define arbitrary splits (not just train/eval). E.g. Doing a `train/eval/test` split is possible.

* Within the instance of a `TrainerStep`, the user has access to `input_patterns` and `output_patterns` which provide the required uris with respect to their splits for the input and output(test_results) examples.

* The built-in trainers are modified to work with the new changes.

## Bug Fixes + Refactor
A big thanks to our new super supporter @zyfzjsc988 for most of the feedback that led to bug fixes and enhancements for this release: 

* #63: Now one can specify which ports ZenML opens its add-on applications.
* #64 Now there is a way to list integrations with the following code:
```
from zenml.utils.requirements_utils import list_integrations.
list_integrations()
```
* Fixed #61: `view_anomalies()` breaking in the quickstart.
* Analytics is now `opt-in` by default, to get rid of the unnecessary prompt at `zenml init`. Users can still freely `opt-out` by using the CLI:

```
zenml config analytics opt-out
```

Again, the telemetry data is fully anonymized and just used to improve the product. Read more [here](https://docs.zenml.io/misc/usage-analytics.html)

# 0.3.5

## New Features
* Added a new interface into the trainer step called [`test_fn`]() which is utilized to produce model predictions and save them as test results

* Implemented a new evaluator step called [`AgnosticEvaluator`]() which is designed to work regardless of the model type as long as you run the `test_fn` in your trainer step

* The first two changes allow torch trainer steps to be followed by an agnostic evaluator step, see the example [here]().

* Proposed a new naming scheme, which is now integrated into the built-in steps, in order to make it easier to handle feature/label names

* Implemented a new adapted version of 2 TFX components, namely the [`Trainer`]() and the [`Evaluator`]() to allow the aforementioned changes to take place

* Modified the [`TorchFeedForwardTrainer`]() to showcase how to use TensorBoard in conjunction with PyTorch


## Bug Fixes + Refactor
* Refactored how ZenML treats relative imports for custom steps. Now:
```python

```

* Updated the [Scikit Example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/scikit), [PyTorch Lightning Example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/pytorch_lightning), [GAN Example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/gan) accordingly. Now they should work according to their README's.

Big shout out to @SarahKing92 in issue #34 for raising the above issues!


# 0.3.4
This release is a big design change and refactor. It involves a significant change in the Configuration file structure, meaning this is a **breaking upgrade**. 
For those upgrading from an older version of ZenML, we ask to please delete their old `pipelines` dir and `.zenml` folders and start afresh with a `zenml init`.

If only working locally, this is as simple as:

```
cd zenml_enabled_repo
rm -rf pipelines/
rm -rf .zenml/
```

And then another ZenML init:

```
pip install --upgrade zenml
cd zenml_enabled_repo
zenml init
```

## New Features
* Introduced another higher-level pipeline: The [NLPPipeline](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/zenml/pipelines/nlp_pipeline.py). This is a generic 
  NLP pipeline for a text-datasource based training task. Full example of how to use the NLPPipeline can be found [here](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/nlp)
* Introduced a [BaseTokenizerStep](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/zenml/steps/tokenizer/base_tokenizer.py) as a simple mechanism to define how to train and encode using any generic 
tokenizer (again for NLP-based tasks).

## Bug Fixes + Refactor
* Significant change to imports: Now imports are way simpler and user-friendly. E.g. Instead of:
```python
from zenml.core.pipelines.training_pipeline import TrainingPipeline
```

A user can simple do:

```python
from zenml.pipelines import TrainingPipeline
```

The caveat is of course that this might involve a re-write of older ZenML code imports.

Note: Future releases are also expected to be breaking. Until announced, please expect that upgrading ZenML versions may cause older-ZenML 
generated pipelines to behave unexpectedly.
