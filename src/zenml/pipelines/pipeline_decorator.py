        name: The name of the pipeline. If left empty, the name of the
            decorated function will be used as a fallback.
        enable_cache: Whether to use caching or not.
        required_integrations: Optional list of ZenML integrations that are
            required to run this pipeline. Run `zenml integration list` for
            a full list of available integrations.
        requirements_file: Optional path to a pip requirements file that
            contains requirements to run the pipeline.
        dockerignore_file: Optional path to a dockerignore file to use when
            building docker images for running this pipeline.
            **Note**: If you pass a file, make sure it does not include the
            `.zen` directory as it is needed to run ZenML inside the container.
