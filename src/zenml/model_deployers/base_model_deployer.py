class BaseModelDeployer(StackComponent, ABC):
    """Base class for all ZenML model deployers.

    The model deployer serves three major purposes:

    1. It contains all the stack related configuration attributes required to
    interact with the remote model serving tool, service or platform (e.g.
    hostnames, URLs, references to credentials, other client related
    configuration parameters).

    2. It implements the continuous deployment logic necessary to deploy models
    in a way that updates an existing model server that is already serving a
    previous version of the same model instead of creating a new model server
    for every new model version (see the `deploy_model` abstract method).
    This functionality can be consumed directly from ZenML pipeline steps, but
    it can also be used outside of the pipeline to deploy ad-hoc models. It is
    also usually coupled with a standard model deployer step, implemented by
    each integration, that hides the details of the deployment process away from
    the user.

    3. It acts as a ZenML BaseService registry, where every BaseService instance
    is used as an internal representation of a remote model server (see the
    `find_model_server` abstract method). To achieve this, it must be able to
    re-create the configuration of a BaseService from information that is
    persisted externally, alongside or even part of the remote model server
    configuration itself. For example, for model servers that are implemented as
    Kubernetes resources, the BaseService instances can be serialized and saved
    as Kubernetes resourece annotations. This allows the model deployer to keep
    track of all externally running model servers and to re-create their
    corresponding BaseService instance representations at any given time.
    The model deployer also defines methods that implement basic life-cycle
    management on remote model servers outside the coverage of a pipeline
    (see `stop_model_server`, `start_model_server` and `delete_model_server`).
