ZenML is an extensible, MLOps focused, pipeline-ing framework.

It allows users to connect functions into data-dependant pipelines.

It allows ML practitioners to write pipelines with a simple syntax, provides highly supported integrations to popular ML tools, and is written to be compiled down to any orchestration framework.

In a lot of ways, ZenML is an infrastructure-abstraction tool similar to [Metaflow](), [Flyte](), and [TFX](). ZenML focuses on the tools:

- Extensibility and control
- Reproducibility
- MLOps stack management
- A well maintained integration
